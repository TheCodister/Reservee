# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

1. Read the instructions carefully

- Open Visual Studio Code.
- First clone this repository by running "git clone https://github.com/TheCodister/HCMUT-SPSS.git" in the terminal.
- Then run "cd client"
- Then run "npm install".
- Then run "npm run dev". Your browser will display the project, if not, go to http://localhost:5173/ or whatever link the terminal displays.

2. Note

- To implement your work,go to the folder 'Pages'. In the folder you will see all the folders that contain the system's page, each folder will have 2 file, a .css file for styling and an index.jsx folder to build the structure, do your work in 2 of these file.
